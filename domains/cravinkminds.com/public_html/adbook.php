    Over the past months we’ve helped a great number of promising writers understand and balance their writing journey and career. These are different students with their own measure of understanding of creative writing. Most, minimal,  and some, a bit conversant. By our training, they’ve been able to fuel their passion and capabilities as effective writers. One of the all too common problems we see in young and promising writers is struggling with putting their desire to write into action.</p>
    <p class="container">We see this struggle and have decided to give this book to writers out there. Many have plans and desires to write some draft. But they never go through with it. Decades upon decades, these ideas are never dug out of their mind into paper. It is because of this problem common among writers that we have decided to give this book freely to everyone at this time.</p>
    <p class="container">“Why you have writer’s block” is an arm of benevolence extended to every writer out there. Get this free guide now to help you strengthen your writing career.</p>
